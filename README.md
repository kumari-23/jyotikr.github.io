    <h1>1. Career summary</h1>
    <p>To help potential employers get a quick grasp of who you are as a professional, you need to include a career summary—a short description of what you do and what makes you special. This section should be one of the first things you list in your career portfolio.
       An ideal career summary does the following:
        Uses 5-7 sentences or bullet points
        Includes numbers and percentages
        Provides specific examples that prove your qualifications for the job
        Convinces the reader to read more about the candidate
    </p>
    <h1>philosophy statement</h1>
    <p>>A philosophy statement, sometimes called a mission statement, describes the things about your profession that matter most to you. By including this statement in your career portfolio, you give recruiters and potential employers insight into your value system and what motivates you. 

        When creating your philosophy statement, it helps to ask yourself the following questions:
        
        “Why is my profession important?”
        “What do I think about my industry?”
        “How do I treat other professionals in my industry (and in general?)” 
        “Which of my skills help me thrive in my work?”
        Your philosophy statement should contain three parts, although they don’t necessarily need to be spread out into three separate paragraphs:
        
        An introduction—This is where you tell readers about your core beliefs and why you do what you do.
        A body—This section goes into greater detail about your values or answers one of the questions listed earlier.
        A conclusion—This is where you summarize your values and what you wrote in the body.</p>
